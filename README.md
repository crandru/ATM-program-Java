# Project code TBA:

ATM program consists of 5 classes:
- ATM
- ATMInterface
- BankServer
- Customer
- Operator

ATM will act as the connecting class between ATMInterface and BankServer, using ATMInterface to take input from the user and send responses back, and using BankServer to verify customer/operator information before performing transactions on their accounts.

Initial class templates will be added prior to writing the actual classes and methods.
